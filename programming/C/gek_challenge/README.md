## challenge proposed by @cyber_gecko_ on the OALabs discord

Create the smallest possible, fully contained (no external input) native x64 linux binary that:
- runs on an unmodified, current linux kernel
- connects to a server (can use mine, 89.168.66.251:1337 or use your own)
- retrieves the data the server sends (24 bytes)
- prints it to stdout

in C ofc because i'm a REAL PROGRAMMER
