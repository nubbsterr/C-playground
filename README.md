# C-playground
A collection of random stuff I've done with C (because we love C)!

Including but not limited to:
* TCP communication over sockets [found under ./programming/C/gek_challenge](./programming/C/gek_challenge)
* XOR encryption magic [found under ./programming/C/xor_encryption_fun](./programming/C/xor_encryption_fun)
* Example programs for basic features of C (all from BroCode's awesome C tutorial) [found under ./programming/C](./programming/C)
* Fun Raylib programs (mostly just shapes cuz we love looking at cubes) [found under ./programming/Raylib](./programming/Raylib)
* (by far my favourite) Rendering graphics using .ppm files and ffmpeg [found under ./programming/Graphics](./programming/Graphics)
* my own toy shell (fsh) made in tandem w/ Stephen Brennan's own tutorial (linked in the C source code) [found under ./programming/C/fsh](./programming/C/fsh)
